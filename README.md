# University of Windsor Bylaws

The University of Windsor Bylaws are a set of regulations that govern the behaviour and activities of students, faculty, staff, and visitors on campus. They outline the rights and responsibilities of the University community and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of its members.

It is important for students to understand the University of Windsor Bylaws because they provide a clear set of rules and expectations that must be followed while on campus. This helps to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment for everyone. Violations of the Bylaws can result in disciplinary action, ranging from a warning to a suspension or expulsion from the University.

The Bylaws cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: 

- Respect for people and property
- Alcohol and drugs
- Use of University facilities
- Harassment and discrimination
- Academic integrity
- Student organizations

The Bylaws are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain relevant and in line with University policies. Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Bylaws and to refer to them whenever necessary.
